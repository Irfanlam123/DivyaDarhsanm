        "Kaal Bhairav Jayanti, also known as Bhairava Ashtami is celebrated with deep reverence as it honours Kaal Bhairav, a fierce manifestation of Lord Shiva. This day will be marked by a grand Mahanusthan at Sri Mandir where rituals are conducted over 12 hours, beginning on the evening of the 22nd and continuing until the early morning hours of the 23rd. The 12-hour Mahaanusthan includes the 4 Prahar Kaal Bhairav Abhishek Puja, Sringar Sewa, Khappar Sewa, and Bhog Sewa, each ritual allowing devotees to experience the divine presence and blessings of Kaal Bhairav in the sacred land of Kashi. Kaal Bhairav holds a deep connection with Kashi, the city known as the abode of Lord Shiva. According to legend, Brahma, the creator, once grew arrogant, seeing himself as supreme. To restore his humility, Lord Shiva manifested as Kaal Bhairav, severing one of Brahma’s heads, symbolising the removal of ego. This act led Kaal Bhairav to incur the sin of Brahmahatya, upon Vishnu’s suggestion, he wandered with Brahma’s skull (Kapala) in his hand until he got liberation from his sins. His journey, known as Kapala Bhiksha, symbolised deep repentance and humility, as he roamed with an empty skull, a reminder of the importance of overcoming pride and ego. Finally, in Kashi, the skull fell from his hand, freeing him from the curse. Then, Lord Shiva declared that Bhairav had conquered the cycle of time, and thus, his name would be ‘Kaal Bhairav,’ and he would be the guardian of Kashi. Thus, Kaal Bhairav is revered as the righteous one, granting devotees relief not only from the sins of this life but from the burdens of all previous lifetimes.",

        "Performing 4 Prahar Kaal Bhairav Abhishek Puja, which involves Sringar Sewa, Khappar Sewa, and Bhog Sewa is believed to invoke Kaal Bhairav’s blessings. The Abhishek Puja, conducted in four prahars (four time segments across the day and night), represents the cycle of time that Kaal Bhairav governs, while the Sringar Sewa involves the adornment of Kaal Bhairav with ceremonial offerings, emphasising his supreme authority. The Khappar Sewa, symbolising the Kapala or skull that Kaal Bhairav carried as penance, is performed to revere his humility and sacrifice. Bhog Sewa, the final phase, involves offering sacred food, signifying gratitude and the fulfilment of wishes. Therefore, this puja will be conducted at the Shri Kaal Bhairav and Adi Kaal Bhairav Temple in Kashi. These rituals are performed to remove 7 past lifetimes’ sins and negativity. Participate in this puja through Sri Mandir and receive blessings of Kaal Bhairav.",
